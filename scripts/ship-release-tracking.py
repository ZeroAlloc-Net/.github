"""Mark everything in the Unshipped release-tracking files as shipped in a release.

Usage, from the root of the repository whose files to move:
    python3 ship-release-tracking.py <version>
    python3 ship-release-tracking.py --check

Two sets of files track what a release contains, and both are only useful when
the Unshipped half is moved into the Shipped half as each version goes out:

* src/*/AnalyzerReleases.{Shipped,Unshipped}.md
  The Roslyn release-tracking analyzers read these. Once a rule is in a
  "## Release x.y.z" section, changing its severity or category, or removing
  it, has to be declared, so an accidental change to a shipped rule fails the build.
* src/*/PublicAPI.{Shipped,Unshipped}*.txt
  The public-API analyzers read these. Entries in Shipped are the API a
  release has promised; *REMOVED* entries in Unshipped delete their Shipped line.
  A suffixed pair such as PublicAPI.Unshipped.modern.txt, used for API that only
  some target frameworks compile, moves into its own PublicAPI.Shipped.modern.txt.

Both are discovered rather than listed, so a new analyzer project or package is
covered without editing this script.

The ship-release-tracking reusable workflow runs this on the release PR branch
with the version that PR releases, so the release commit carries the move. The
script is idempotent: with nothing unshipped it changes no file.

--check changes nothing. It lists every Unshipped entry and exits 1 if there is
any. The release-tracking reusable workflow runs it on release PRs, so a release
cannot merge with entries unmoved.

This is the shared copy in ZeroAlloc-Net/.github. It started as
scripts/ship-release-tracking.py in ZeroAlloc.ORM, which proved it on the 2.0.1
release; see ZeroAlloc-Net/.github#38.
